# Totally-not-a-rat
Totally not a rat is an overlay written in C++

Yes "Totally not a rat" is the name of this overlay and trust me it isn't a rat its just a name I came up with when I shared an early version of it with some friends. This project is me just trying to learn C++ so I don't expect anyone to actually use it
